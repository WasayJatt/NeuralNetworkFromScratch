# Handwritten Digit Classification With Neural Network From Scratch

## Overview

This project demonstrates a custom implementation of a Neural Network for classifying handwritten digits, built entirely from scratch without using high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Features

- **Fully Custom Implementation**: Neural network designed and coded manually.
- **Digit Classification**: Recognizes handwritten digits with high accuracy.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides insights into the training process.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WasayJatt/NeuralNetworkFromScratch.git
    cd NeuralNetworkFromScratch
    ```

2. Execute the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Example Output
